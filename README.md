# python-challege
The instructions are to create a Python script to analyze two datasets: one for PyBank which includes "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns, and one for PyPoll which includes "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate" columns. For PyBank, you are to calculate the total number of months, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses", the average change in "Profit/Losses", the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease in profits. For PyPoll, you are to calculate the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. The results of both analyses should be printed to the terminal and exported to a text file. The code should be saved in a new repository called "python-challenge" with a main.py file and a Resources folder that contains the CSV files, and an analysis folder that contains the text file with the results.
